/**
 * Drives a recorded game, for the shared-replay page.
 *
 * Deliberately returns the same `Session` shape as `useGameSession`, so the
 * replay is drawn by the real `Board` — the same tiles, the same flight
 * animation, the same round settlement — rather than by a second renderer that
 * would drift from the game it claims to show. Interaction is simply switched
 * off: `canSelect`/`canPlace` answer false and `place` is a no-op.
 *
 * No agent runs here: the opponent's moves come from the record. That is what
 * makes playback faithful even if the agents later change, or if the original
 * search was cut short by the safety cap (see `src/replay/codec.ts`).
