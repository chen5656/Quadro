/**
 * The one attempt that survives a page load: the score a player finished while
 * signed out, held across the sign-in round-trip.
 *
 * D-020 keeps unsent scores off disk, and this stays inside that rule as
 * narrowly as it can. A social sign-in *leaves the page* (`signIn.social`
 * redirects to the provider and back), so an in-memory attempt is gone by the
 * time the player is authenticated and the score they just played never
 * reaches the board. The record lives in sessionStorage — same tab, cleared
 * when it closes — and is dropped as soon as it is posted, discarded, or stale.
