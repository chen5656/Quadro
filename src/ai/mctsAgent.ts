/**
 * The `extreme` level — open-loop determinized UCT.
 *
 * Chance only enters at a round boundary (the deal), and the bag's composition
 * is public — only the draw order is random. So instead of building a node per
 * possible deal, each simulation draws its own deal when it crosses a boundary
 * and the statistics for different deals aggregate on the same node (open loop).
 * That keeps the tree small and is why ISMCTS is not needed here.
 *
 * Because deals differ between simulations, the set of legal actions at a node
 * differs too; selection always intersects the node's children with the actions
 * that are actually legal in *this* simulation.
