/**
 * `GET /api/me/history` — the signed-in player's own attempts.
 *
 * One row per (day, opponent), which is exactly what `scores` already stores:
 * the table keeps a player's best attempt per board, so the history is a read
 * of rows that were always there rather than a new write path.
 *
 * Rank is computed per row against that day's board. That is one COUNT per
 * row, so the page size is deliberately small — a snapshot column would be
 * cheaper, but it would also have to be backfilled for every existing row and
 * kept correct as later players post.
