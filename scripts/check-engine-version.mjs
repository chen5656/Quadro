/**
 * Fails the build when the engine changes without `ENGINE_VERSION` moving.
 *
 * Shared replays store a seed and a list of action ids, and rebuild every board
 * by re-running the engine. A change to how tiles are dealt or how an action
 * resolves therefore makes every replay ever shared decode into a *different*
 * game — silently, and long after the change shipped. `ENGINE_VERSION` is what
 * lets the player refuse those instead of drawing a game nobody played, so it
 * has to move whenever the engine does.
 *
 * The check is a content hash of the engine files, recorded next to the
 * version. When the hash moves and the version does not, this fails and tells
 * you what to do.
